# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
  
I am proud of the amount of vocabulary and sequences of code I have learned. I am proud that I asked for help after spinning my wheels for 25 minutes.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
  
Methods is very useful and intuitive once you can use it properly. It a repertoire of pre-made methods that can do all algebraic operations and manipulate data.  The power comes in with the time management. IF you  have to use a particular method a lot in your field of work, you could make your own and then reuse it infinitly.
